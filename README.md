## About AI-Factory

AI-Factory focuses on developing AI models for specialized purposes, addressing unique challenges across diverse industries. Our mission is to harness the power of decentralized networks to create AI solutions that are efficient, scalable, and adaptable.

## Competition Tracks

We are excited to announce our upcoming competition, featuring two distinct tracks:

### 1. Research Track

This track aims to develop AI models capable of generating original scientific ideas, with a particular emphasis on proposing new methods in the AI domain. Participants will explore the potential of generative AI in devising innovative solutions to complex scientific problems.

### 2. Demo Track

The demo track serves as a platform to continuously produce AI models addressing specific problems, aiming to impress end-users and deliver value across various industries. We envision that, in the future, models from the research track could automate the ideation process for the demo track, reducing the need for manual brainstorming of intriguing AI topics.

## Roadmap

Our planned milestones are as follows:

1. **Q2 2025:** Launch the first competition focusing on "Scientist AI" to kickstart our initiatives.

2. **Q4 2025:** Initiate the demo track, providing a continuous platform for showcasing AI solutions.

3. **From 2026:** Officially deploy the winning models for demo purposes

## Getting Started
