# Research Track: Developing AI for Original Scientific Idea Generation

The **Research Track** aims to develop artificial intelligence (AI) systems capable of generating original, feasible, and highly novel scientific ideas. Traditional large language models (LLMs) often face criticism for their tendency to memorize information and produce hallucinations, limiting their ability to reason and innovate like humans. To address these challenges, we are exploring advanced training methodologies, such as those employed in models like DeepSeek-R1, to enhance reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning (RL).

DeepSeek-R1 has demonstrated that applying RL directly to a base model can lead to the emergence of sophisticated reasoning behaviors, including self-verification, reflection, and extended chain-of-thought generation. This approach has enabled the model to achieve performance levels comparable to leading AI systems, such as OpenAI's o1â€“1217, while reducing reliance on supervised fine-tuning.

## Initial Phase

In the initial phase of the Research Track, participants will pretrain a 500-million-parameter model using a subset of the arXiv dataset from togethercomputer/RedPajama-Data-1T . This foundational step will establish a robust base for subsequent training phases.

## Future Plans

- **Scaling the Model:** Expanding the model to 3 billion parameters to enhance its capacity for complex reasoning and idea generation.

- **Incorporating Long-Form Reasoning Datasets:** Training the model with datasets distilled from DeepSeek to further refine its reasoning abilities.

- **Developing Novelty and Correctness Metrics:** Establishing new metrics to assess the originality and accuracy of the generated scientific ideas.

By integrating these strategies, the Research Track aspires to push the boundaries of AI's capability to autonomously develop innovative scientific concepts, thereby contributing significantly to the advancement of artificial intelligence in scientific research.
